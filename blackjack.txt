My blackjack code is split into two main parts, one is the user's turn and the other is the dealer's turn. for the user's turn, they are given their first card, if the card drawn in the code is 11, 12, or 13 (jack, queen, king) then an if statement immedietly follows to turn that card value to 10 before it is shown to the user. Then another if statement follows in the code where if a 1 is drawn, the user is given the option to count that as either a 1 or 11. The card value is then added to the user's sum and the user is given the option to continue drawing cards, with all the conditions from before still apllying. After the user ends their turn, dealer's turn starts with all the same conditions, except the option to choose if an ace becomes a 1 or 11. If the dealer's sum is greater than or equal to the user's sum, the code prints a message that the dealer won and the code breaks out of the while loop.
