In this code, the user inputs the values for the credit limit, current balance, APR, and monthly payment. Then the computation section finds the interest, monthly total payments, and new balance using the given formulas. The biggest part of this code is the output section where the formatting is %8.2d, the 8 specifies the field width and the .2 specifies 2 places after the decimal place. Then I have the final print statement print the total monthly payments and how many months it will take.
