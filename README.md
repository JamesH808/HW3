This contains 2 different projects. The first being a credit card debt caluclator that determins how long it would take to pay off a card based off of the limit, 
monthly payment amounts, and other factors. The second project is a blackjack game where the user plays against a "bot" that draws random cards and plays based off of rules
that usual dealers play by, like standing at a certain value. The user also has a choice as to what value they want to play an Ace as.
